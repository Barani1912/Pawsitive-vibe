              <ul>
                <li>Prepare a Cozy Space: Set up a comfortable, quiet area where your dog can relax and feel safe as they adjust to their new surroundings.</li>
                <li>Introduce Gradually: Allow your dog to explore their new home slowly. Introduce family members and other pets in a calm, controlled manner.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3><li>Nutrition and Health          </li></h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Balanced Diet: Provide high-quality food tailored to your dog‚Äôs age, breed, and health needs. Consult a vet to ensure your dog is getting the right nutrients.</li>
                <li>Hydration: Ensure fresh, clean water is always available.</li>
                <li>Vet Check-up: Schedule a vet appointment shortly after adoption to address vaccinations, health checks, and parasite control.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3><li>Exercise and Training         </li></h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Daily Exercise: Regular walks and playtime are essential to keeping your dog physically fit and mentally stimulated.</li>
                <li>Training: Start basic training early to establish commands, good behavior, and house rules. Positive reinforcement works best with newly adopted dogs.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Introduce to New Surroundings Slowly: Gradually expose your dog to new environments, people, and other pets to encourage positive social behavior.</li>
                <li>Be Patient: Every dog adjusts at their own pace. Some may settle in quickly, while others need more time to feel secure and comfortable.</li>
